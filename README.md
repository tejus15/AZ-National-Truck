We categorized the drivers based on their risk factors​

Low Risk (46 nos.): Drivers with riskfactor of less than or equal to 7​

High Risk (53 nos.): Drivers with riskfactor of more than 7​

Only 1 driver out of the 100 drivers had no riskfactor. The driver is A19 and she/ he has no risky events.​

A97 has the highest risk factor of 31.7 and also has the highest risky events count of 14​

Project brief mentioned risk-factor’s maximum value is set at 10 while we got several risk factor values over 10
